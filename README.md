# Grade Visualization Application

This page of our project is a web application built with Angular and Highcharts to visualize student grades. The application provides three different charts:

1. **Average Grades by Student**
2. **Average Grades by Subject**
3. **Individual Student Grades**

## Features

### 1. Average Grades by Student
This bar chart shows the average grades for all students. Each bar represents a student, and the height corresponds to their average grade across all subjects.

### 2. Average Grades by Subject
This bar chart displays the average grades for each subject. Each bar represents a subject, and the height reflects the average grade for that subject.

### 3. Individual Student Grades
This line chart allows users to visualize the grades of a specific student across different subjects. The user can enter a student name, and the chart dynamically updates to show the grades for the entered student.
